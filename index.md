I am Teesta Naskar,a Neuroscientist by profession. My long-term research interests involve the development of a comprehensive understanding about the intricate workings of the human brain, how the unique interplay of an individual's genetic blueprint and the dynamic landscape of epigenetic regulation shapes diverse phenotypes and behavioral manifestations. Precisely it lies in investigating how early environmental exposures influence brain development, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral manifestations. I am committed to uncovering the underlying mechanisms by which various environmental factors during critical periods of brain development contribute to the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric conditions.

My academic training and research experiences have provided me with an excellent background in multiple biological disciplines including neuroscience, genetics, computational biology, bioinformatics, high through genome sequencing and proteomics data analysis, comparative genomics and evolutionary biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology.
